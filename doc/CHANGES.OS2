This document contains a brief list of the most important OS/2-specific changes
in the OpenJDK product from release to release.


CHANGES


1.6.0 Build 19 RC (2011-02-21)

  - Ported and enabled the JPDA (Java Platform Debugger Architecture) component
    which provides a framework for debugging Java applications.

  - Added sound (audio and MIDI) support to Java applications using DART.

  - Added a free implementation of the com.sun.image.codec.jpeg package (taken
    from the IcedTea project) used by some old Java applications like Jeti/2.

  - Renamed all Java DLLs by adding a 'j' prefix to the names to avoid possible
    conflicts with system DLLs.

  - Fixed: Accessing the network from Java applications would crash on some
    machines (Odin bug).

  - Fixed: Spontaneous 100% CPU load in many Java applications (e.g. GenealogyJ
    Jeti/2) when throwing NullPointerException as a result of accessing null
    objects of some application classes (Odin bug).

  - Fixed: java.util.prefs.Preferences: Use the Open32 registry on OS/2 instead
    of throwing an exception.

  - Fixed: JVM used PATH instead of LIBPATH to comprise java.library.path
    resulting in inability to find JNI DLLs in some applications.

  - Fixed: Crash in java.io.WinNTFileSystem.getSpace() (Odin bug).

  - Fixed: Exception java.awt.image.ImagingOpException in many applications due
    to wrong exports from in jmlibimg.dll.


1.6.0 Build 19 Beta 2 (2011-01-12)

  - Added a predefined font configuration file to use the Liberation font family
    as Java system fonts (see README.OS2 for details).

  - Added the jawt.lib library to the SDK package.

  - Added some missing GUI and audio classes to rt.jar.

  - Fixed: Java could not find a .jar file in the current directory when
    starting it with 'java -jar filename.jar'.

  - Fixed: Non-ASCII characters in the title bar of any Java window would be
    drawn using wrong glyphs.

  - Fixed: Java could incorrectly detect the default object heap size on some
    systems for some specific VIRTUALADDRESS values and abort at startup with a
    "Could not reserve enough space for object heap" error message.

  - Fixed: java.io.File.mkdirs() wouild always fail which would in particular
    abort the installation process of some applications such as jEdit, iTrain
    (this bug was actually fixed in Odin).

  - Fixed: An attempt to use Drag & Drop in any Java application would cause
    a Java exception and program termination.


1.6.0 Build 19 Beta (2010-12-30)

  - Added support for AWT and Swing classes which brings GUI capabilities.

  - Lots of small fixes.
