  - Fixed: Accessing the network from Java applications would crash on some
    machines (Odin bug).

  - Fixed: spontaneous 100% CPU load in many Java applications (e.g. GenealogyJ
    Jeti/2) when throwing NullPointerException as a result of accessing null
    objects of some application classes (Odin bug).

  - Added a predefined font configuration file to use the Liberation font family

    systems for some specific VIRTUALADDRESS values and abort at startup with a
    "Could not reserve enough space for object heap" error message.

  - Fixed: java.io.File.mkdirs() wouild always fail which would in particular
    abort the installation process of some applications such as jEdit, iTrain
