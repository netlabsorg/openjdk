# This script is used by the stamps/html-gen target in Makefile.am. Its purpose
# is to produce HTML-escaped and formatted documents from a set of plaintext
# documents, namely AUTHORS, NEWS, ChangeLog, and COPYING, located in the
# same directory as this script. These generated HTML documents are then used
# in the netx About Dialog, which can be invoked with "javaws -about".

# The only configuration option is the number of Changesets, and the files processed
# are hardcoded. To run the script manually, create a directory "html-gen" in the
# same directory as this script, containing files named AUTHORS, NEWS, ChangeLog,
# and COPYING. Note that these files WILL be modified in-place during the HTML
# "conversion" process. Setting the environment variable "HTML_GEN_DEBUG" to "true"
# will enable some output from the script, which may be useful if you encounter
# issues with this script's processing of an input file.
# The number of Changesets to process into the ChangeLog can be set by setting the
# environment variable HTML_GEN_CHANGESETS, or by passing an integer argument to
# the script. The parameter will take priority over the environment variable.
