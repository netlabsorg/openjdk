"apt" project README.

This project is for working on the annotation processing tool (apt)
in the OpenJDK langtools component.

The tool was provided in Java 1.5, but has been superceded by new
features in the compiler (javac) in Java 6. apt itself is now 
deprecated, and any further devlopment on it is strongly discouraged.

The main class for the tool is com.sun.tools.apt.Main.

NetBeans 5.0 or later is required and sufficient to use this
project, and others in the OpenJDK langtools component. 
This is different from other projects in OpenJDK, which 
require version 6.0 or later.
