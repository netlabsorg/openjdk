"doclets" project README.

This project is for working on the standard doclets used by 
the documentation tool (javadoc) in the OpenJDK langtools component.

The doclets are invoked as part of the documentation tool (javadoc). 
Using this project, you can also browse javadoc and any tools in langtools.
If you build the doclets, javadoc will be built automatically as well,
if necessary.

The doclets are found in com.sun.tools.doclets.

NetBeans 5.0 or later is required and sufficient to use this
project, and others in the OpenJDK langtools component. 
This is different from other projects in OpenJDK, which 
require version 6.0 or later.
