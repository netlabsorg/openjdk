"compiler" project README.

This project is for working on the compiler tool (javac)
in the OpenJDK langtools component.

The main class for the tool is com.sun.tools.javac.Main.

NetBeans 5.0 or later is required and sufficient to use this
project, and others in the OpenJDK langtools component. 
This is different from other projects in OpenJDK, which 
require version 6.0 or later.
