"javah" project README.

This project is for working on the native header tool (javah) 
in the OpenJDK langtools component.

javah is built on top of the documentation tool (javadoc). Using this
project, you can also browse javadoc and any other tools in langtools.
If you build javah, javadoc will be built automatically as well,
if necessary.

javah is in the process of being converted so that it runs directly on
top of the compiler, javac, using the annotation processing API, 
instead of on top of the documentation tool, javadoc, using the
Doclet API.

The main class for the tool is com.sun.tools.javah.Main.

NetBeans 5.0 or later is required and sufficient to use this
project, and others in the OpenJDK langtools component. 
This is different from other projects in OpenJDK, which 
require version 6.0 or later.
