  @summary Content of the Window should be laid out in the area left after WarningWindow was added.
  @author yuri nesterenko: area=

*/

// Note there is no @ in front of test above.  This is so that the
//  harness will not mistake this file as a test file.  It should
//  only see the html file as a test file. (the harness runs all
//  valid test files, so it would run this test twice if this file
//  were valid as well as the html file.)
// Also, note the area= after Your Name in the author tag.  Here, you
//  should put which functional area the test falls in.  See the
//  AWT-core home page -> test areas and/or -> AWT team  for a list of
//  areas.
// Note also the 'AutomaticAppletTest.html' in the run tag.  This should
//  be changed to the name of the test.

// such as the Mac, separate VMs are not possible and non-applet
// tests will cause problems).  Also, you don't have to worry about
// synchronisation stuff in Applet tests they way you do in main
