# GLOBAL_KPIC: If set means all libraries are PIC, position independent code
#    EXCEPT for select compiles
#    If a .o file is compiled non-PIC then it should be forced
#	   into the RW data segment with a mapfile option. This is done
#    with object files which generated from .s files.
#    The -ztext enforces that no relocations remain in the text segment
#    so that it remains purely read-only for optimum system performance.
#    Some libraries may use a smaller size (13bit -Kpic) on sparc instead of 
#    (32 bit -KPIC) and will override GLOBAL_KPIC appropriately.
