Working on the "langtools" workspace using NetBeans.

This directory (make/netbeans) contains NetBeans projects that
allow you to work on the various tools using the NetBeans IDE.

NetBeans 5.0 or later is required and sufficient to use these 
projects. This is different from other projects in OpenJDK, 
which requires version 6.0 or later.

The following projects are provided:

compiler: for working on the compiler, javac
javadoc:  for working on the documentation tool, javadoc
doclets:  for working on the standard doclets used by the 
 	  documentation tool, javadoc
javah:    for working on the C header tool, javah
javap:    for working on the disassembler, javap
apt:      for working on the annotation processing tool, apt.
          Note that this is just provided for completeness;
          the tool has been superceded by new features in javac,
          and work on apt itself is discouraged.

However, any tool can be worked on from any project; the only difference
between these projects is the behavior of the standard NetBeans actions,
so that "Build" in the compiler project will build the compiler, etc.
