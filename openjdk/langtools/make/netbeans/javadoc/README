"javadoc" project README.

This project is for working on the documentation tool (javadoc) 
in the OpenJDK langtools component.

javadoc is built on top of the compiler (javac). Using this
project, you can also browse javac and any tools in langtools.
If you build javadoc, javac will be built automatically as well,
if necessary.

The main class for the tool is com.sun.tools.javadoc.Main.

NetBeans 5.0 or later is required and sufficient to use this
project, and others in the OpenJDK langtools component. 
This is different from other projects in OpenJDK, which 
require version 6.0 or later.
