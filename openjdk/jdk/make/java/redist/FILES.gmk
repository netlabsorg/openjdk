# The oblique versions of the font are derived from the base versions
# and since 2D can do this derivation on the fly at run time there is no
# need to redistribute the fonts. An exception to this is on Linux.
# The reason is that the Lucidas are specified in the font.properties files
# on Linux, and so AWT/Motif components expect to be able to ask the Xserver
# for these oblique fonts, but the Xserver cannot do the same derivation as
# 2D can.
