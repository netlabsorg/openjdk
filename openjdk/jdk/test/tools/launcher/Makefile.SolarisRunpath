# This is a not quite automated Makefile to generate the Solaris
# binaries used for the SolarisRunpath.sh test.  First,
# libraryCaller.java program must be compiled.  Next, javah is called
# on the class file to generate the needed header file for the jni
# code.  Then, 2 Solaris executables are generated in separate
# directories, a default one meant to be pointed to by LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# (this function returns 0) and another one for the data model
# specific LD_LIBRARY_PATH (this function returns the size of integers
# in the data model, 32 or 64).  A better makefile would run, say
# isainfo -v, and generated binaries for all supported data models.
# To do this a mapping would be needed from data models to
# architecture dependent compiler options; e.g. 64 bit on sparc =>
# -xarch=v9.  Also, the settings for JINCLUDE, JAVAC, and JAVAH should
# come from the current build.  The C compiler should be the one
# approved for the build.  To be extra safe, the binaries should be
# generated on the oldest Solaris release supported by the current
# Java build.

# Include directory in JRE or JDK install; e.g.
JINCLUDE=/java/re/jdk/1.4.1/latest/binaries/solaris-sparc/include

# Path to javac executable; e.g.
JAVAC=/java/re/jdk/1.4.1/promoted/fcs/b21/binaries/solaris-sparc/bin/javac

# Path to javah executable; e.g.
JAVAH=/java/re/jdk/1.4.1/promoted/fcs/b21/binaries/solaris-sparc/bin/javah

CC=/java/devtools/sparc/SUNWspro/SC6.1/bin/cc
