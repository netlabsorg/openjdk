OpenJDK 6 for OS/2 and eCS

Requirements (draft)

1. GCC 4.4.2 + WLINK (ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/qt4/gcc-4_4_2-complete-20091205.zip)
2. Odin32 SDK (take from SVN at http://svn.netlabs.org/repos/odin32)
3. Java 1.5.0 (so far, download link is to be clarified)
4. Ant 1.8.1 and above (http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi)

Copy LocalEnv.tpl.cmd to LocalEnv.cmd and alter according to your environment
and then use env.cmd to set it up.

It is recommended to download ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/qt4/tools/se11.zip to
have env.cmd called automatically whenever you enter "se something" in any
directory inside the project root.

See http://svn.netlabs.org/java for more details.
